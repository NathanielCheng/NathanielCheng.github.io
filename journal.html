	<p>I made my personal website! It's still a work in progress, but it looks pretty good. Improvements will come in no time.<p>

<p>10/24/19<p>
	<p>My project will be a circle drawing game, where a user can draw a digital circle on the board and their circle will be "judged" regarding how close to a perfect circle it is.<p>

<p>11/1/19<p>
	<p>I'm happy that it's November, and that Halloween is over. I hate Halloween. I started working on creating a perfect circle in scratch, and now I am trying to find a way to determine whether or not a circle is perfect, and if not, how close to perfect it is.<p>

<p>11/5/19<p>
	<p>I'm going to push some website updates today. I fixed an issue with my circle website by changing the z-index values of some divs.<p>

<p>Function Homework:<p>
	<p>I made a function that generates a random number, and then, based on that number, changes the color of a box div to either green or red.<p> 



		<p>Array Hw:<p>
			<p>I made a function with a button that, when clicked, adds a new term to the existing array.<p>

<p>Gift Website:<p>
	<p>I made a website for my dad's birthday with a div that followed the mouse and would block the mouse from clicking a link if the user wasn't fast enough. The design of the website included a fancy transition of the words, "Happy Birthday". The code for this transition was not mine, but the rest of the code was, including the sub-website that was accessible through an link.

	<p>Steps:<p>
		<p>1. Invisible div in the middle of the screen.
2. Div has event listener attached so that when it is clicked, it generates a random number that is either rounded up or down to a whole number.
3. Each background image is assigned to a certain whole number, probably between 1 and 10.
4. The random number chosen determines which background images are presented when the div is clicked, which is done through if functions.<p>
