	<p>I made my personal website! It's still a work in progress, but it looks pretty good. Improvements will come in no time.<p>

	<p>My project will be a circle drawing game, where a user can draw a digital circle on the board and their circle will be "judged" regarding how close to a perfect circle it is. This won't be easy to do, but I like math, and I think the best way to distill a love for math in others, especially younger kids is through simple games like this.<p>

	<p>I'm happy that it's November, and that Halloween is over. I hate Halloween. I started working on creating a perfect circle in scratch, and now I am trying to find a way to determine whether or not a circle is perfect, and if not, how close to perfect it is.<p>

	<p>I'm going to push some website updates today.<p>

<p>Function Homework<p>
	<p>I made a working function, but then when I tried to add another event listener, I kept getting format errors. It was so frustrating, so I just left it as it was. The code was supposed to have the square change colors when the mouse was clicked, and it was supposed to change in opacity when the mouse was moved. Here is the link, "file:///Users/student/Desktop/repositories/Functionhomework.html" <p>
